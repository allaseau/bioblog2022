# Contribute?

If you would like to contribute, please try to adhere to the coding standards I have detailed below, if you have any questions or believe I have missed something, please contact me, ideally all code should adhere to PSR2.

## Pull requests

Pull requests should be from a branch in your fork, please also try to give your branch a name that relates to the change/feature you want me to merge. Most importantly, before creating a pull request, please update your fork.

## Files

* Use UTF-8 character encoding.
* Unix formatted, (LF).
* A line length of 120 characters, this is not in any way a fixed requirement, please let context dictate, don't make code harder to read by wrapping it to hit a particular line length.
* All code and comments should be in English.
* Spaces for all indenting, I recommend four spaces per tab.

## PHP

* Please always use ```<?php ... ?>```, never ```<? ... ?>```.
* PHP ```CONSTANTS``` should all be in ```UPPERCASE```.
* PHP keywords should be in ```lowercase```, including, ```true```, ```false``` and ```null```.
* Braces on their own line for classes, namespaces and functions
* Braces in line for if/while etc
* ```UpperCamelCase``` for classes, interfaces etc.
* ```lowerCamelCase``` for methods and functions
* ```lowercase_with_underscores``` for multiple word variables/fields
