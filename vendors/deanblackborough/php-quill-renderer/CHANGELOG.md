# Changelog

Full changelog for PHP Quill Renderer

## v4.00.0 - 2021-02-16

* Update requirements to PHP 8 or PHP 7.4.
* Update tests to run on latest version of PHP Unit.
* Removed Travis config, will switch to GitHub actions at some point soon.

## v3.18.1 - 2019-12-10

* Videos with custom attributes supported, thank you [Nicholas Humphries](https://github.com/Humni).

## v3.18.0 - 2019-11-24

* Custom attributes values which aren't strings are ignored.
* Custom attributes which the parser should ignore can now be defined. 

## v3.17.4 - 2019-05-01

* Allow decoded json to be passed in rather than the library decode it, thank you [Lode Claassen](https://github.com/lode).
* Validation code DRY, thank you [Lode Claassen](https://github.com/lode).

## v3.17.3 - 2019-04-10

* Missing supported format in exception methods, thank you [Lode Claassen](https://github.com/lode).

## v3.17.2 - 2019-03-09

* Additional work to fix [#117](https://github.com/deanblackborough/php-quill-renderer/issues/117),
allow through any empty insert, some are valid so for now just render what quill wants, I'll 
add strict mode later to remove what I consider to be the redundant inserts.

## v3.17.1 - 2019-03-07

* Fixed [#117](https://github.com/deanblackborough/php-quill-renderer/issues/117), compound
deltas not aware of the fact that they can also be links.
* Fixed [#109](https://github.com/deanblackborough/php-quill-renderer/issues/109) again as it 
appears I did not fix it correctly before.

## v3.17.0 - 2019-03-04

* Handle custom color attribute in a better way, assign to style attribute if sensible, 
thank you [Alex](https://github.com/AlexFence). Accepted PR as is, only handles colour, 
will extend feature in v3.18.0.
* Fixed [#108](https://github.com/deanblackborough/php-quill-renderer/issues/108), 
links within headers not correctly rendering, headers now support child deltas.
* Fixed [#109](https://github.com/deanblackborough/php-quill-renderer/issues/109), 
not correctly closing paragraphs or detecting list type change.
* Removed the `ParserSplitInterface` interface, no use anymore.
* Changed which class implements `ParserAttributeInterface` interface.
* Removed redundant methods from parsers.
* Code formatting and comment corrections.

## v3.16.0 - 2019-02-28

* Reworked the parser, split deltas much sooner to try and simplify some of the later logic.
* Return deltas pretty much exactly as defined, most of the new lines intact, I'm thinking about 
adding a `strict` mode that will generate what I consider to be better HTML.
* Update to the README explaining my plans for v4.
* Reworked a couple of tests and removed one or two that I did not consider to be useful.
* Coding standard correction thanks to [Lode Claassen](https://github.com/lode)

## v3.15.0 - 2018-10-25

* Added support for `Color` delta type, it creates a span with a style="color: #xxx" definition, 
thank you (https://github.com/on2)

Notes

The implementation works and does not break anything, however, I will extend the feature in the future. 
It should really be handled in the same way unknown attributes are handled in the plain Insert `delta`. 
The Insert delta only deals with a simple key and value, it needs to be extended to allow complex values, 
that way an attribute like `{"attributes":{"style":{"color": #e60000"}}` could generate the same output 
and allow much more flexibility. I'm happy to leave the `Color` delta in until the next major version as I 
believe it is a feature other people may use.

* Added credit to [Mark Davison](https://github.com/markdavison) - Missing in the v3.00.0 release.

## v3.00.0 - 2018-05-08

v3.00.0 is an almost complete rewrite of v2.03.1, the new design is flexible and supports all the features of the 
previous versions without any blatant hacks, no more methods named checkLastItemClosed() or 
removeRedundantParentTags(), the renderer is simpler because it just needs to iterate over a Deltas array.

There was no change to the API. However, if you use it by calling the parser and renderer classes directly I renamed 
one method, `\DBlackborough\Quill\Parser\HTML::content()` is now `\DBlackborough\Quill\Parser\HTML::deltas()`.

## 2.03.1 - 2018-04-15

* Minor bug fix and test thanks to pdiveris (https://github.com/pdiveris), deals with null inserts.
* Updated README, feature list incorrect, added v3.0 and also added a message on v1/v2 development. 

## 2.03.0 - 2018-03-03

* Updated composer.json, added suggest for PHP7.2.
* Removed /example folder and updated .gitignore.
* Added deltas() method to Parser/HTML.php.
* Added parserLoaded() method to Render.php

### v0.20 - 2017-02-26

I got most of the way through adding basic support for lists and then stumbled on a problem, I need to rework 
 how newlines are handled and tidy up the code, the code needs to become aware of block elements.

* Reworked rendering code.
* Added base class so additional rendering class can be developed, for example a markdown renderer.

### v0.10 - 2017-02-26

attribute can be set along with the attributes to use for newlines and paragraphs, 
defaults to `br` and `p`.
